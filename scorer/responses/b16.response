 <COREF ID="2" REF="-1">Chrysler Corp.</COREF> this year will take the highly unusual step of setting up <COREF ID="3" REF="-2">a formal grievance procedure</COREF> for its non-union white-collar <COREF ID="-21" REF="16">employees</COREF>. 


 "<COREF ID="6">We</COREF> understand that (<COREF ID="7" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF>'s) dramatic restructuring . . . will inevitably lead many <COREF ID="-26" REF="16">employees</COREF> to question <COREF ID="-28" REF="12">management</COREF>'s decisions and actions," Anthony P. <COREF ID="-35" REF="13">St.</COREF> John, <COREF ID="8" REF="33">vice president for human resources</COREF> of the <COREF ID="-38" REF="22">auto</COREF> maker's <COREF ID="-40" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF> Motors subsidiary, said in a speech at Oakland University <COREF ID="10">here</COREF> yesterday. 
 "<COREF ID="-51" REF="16">Employees</COREF> may not feel that <COREF ID="11" REF="30">they</COREF> are being treated fairly." 


 To "strengthen <COREF ID="12" REF="-28">management</COREF>'s credibility," <COREF ID="13" REF="-35">Mr. St. John</COREF> added, <COREF ID="14" REF="-136">the company</COREF> will set up <COREF ID="15">an "alternative disputes resolution" system</COREF> similar to a traditional union <COREF ID="-61" REF="3">grievance</COREF> procedure. 


 "For the first time <COREF ID="16" REF="-21">these employees</COREF> will be guaranteed <COREF ID="17" REF="3">a formal and impartial internal mechanism</COREF> to resolve discipline, discharge, and employment opportunity disputes," <COREF ID="18" REF="13">Mr. St. John</COREF> said. 


 <COREF ID="19" REF="-3">The process</COREF> will have several steps, concluding with final <COREF ID="-78" REF="29">arbitration</COREF> handled by a neutral third party. 


 <COREF ID="-81" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF>'s <COREF ID="-82" REF="27">move</COREF> apparently was inspired by the turmoil created by <COREF ID="21" REF="23">its</COREF> current cost-cutting and restructuring, forces which are transforming many industrial companies. 
 <COREF ID="22" REF="-38">The auto maker</COREF> is significantly changing wage and benefit plans, and is trying to slash <COREF ID="23" REF="21">its</COREF> white-collar rolls, particularly in the wake of <COREF ID="24" REF="21">its</COREF> acquisition last year of American Motors Corp. 


 <COREF ID="25" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF> has <COREF ID="26" REF="16">about 31,000 white-collar employees in the U.S.</COREF>, up sharply from roughly 21,000 in 1982. 
 About 6,000 salaried workers are currently represented by the United Auto Workers union. 
 Some analysts speculated <COREF ID="27" REF="-82">the move</COREF> is designed to stave off further union organizing in <COREF ID="28" REF="26">the white-collar ranks</COREF>. 


 Several <COREF ID="-125" REF="12">management</COREF> consultants said <COREF ID="29" REF="3">a formal grievance procedure with third-party arbitration</COREF> was common for government <COREF ID="-131" REF="16">employees</COREF>, but <COREF ID="30" REF="11">they</COREF> had never heard of such <COREF ID="31" REF="-175">a policy</COREF> for non-union <COREF ID="-135" REF="16">employees</COREF> at a major private <COREF ID="-136" REF="14">company</COREF>. 


 "<COREF ID="32" REF="49">It</COREF> has the potential of undermining supervisory and <COREF ID="-140" REF="12">management</COREF> responsibility and authority," said Jerrold Bratkovich, <COREF ID="33" REF="8">a vice president</COREF> in the Los Angeles office of the Hay Group, a <COREF ID="-154" REF="12">management</COREF> consulting firm. 
 "That's one of the main reasons employers don't want to have unionization." 


 A <COREF ID="-160" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF> <COREF ID="-161" REF="42">spokesman</COREF> said <COREF ID="37" REF="14">the company</COREF> had studied "a couple" of other companies that had <COREF ID="38" REF="29">arbitration for nonunion employees</COREF>, but <COREF ID="39">he</COREF> couldn't recall which companies. 


 A more common business approach is the "open-door" <COREF ID="-175" REF="31">policy</COREF> such as that at International Business Machines Corp., where "any employee who has a problem which has not been resolved to satisfaction . . . can bring the complaint to the attention of higher <COREF ID="-186" REF="12">management</COREF>," said an <COREF ID="-190" REF="41">IBM</COREF> <COREF ID="-191" REF="42">spokesman</COREF>. 


 "If the employee is still not satisfied, the problem can be reviewed with the <COREF ID="41" REF="-190">IBM</COREF> chief executive officer," <COREF ID="42" REF="-161">the spokesman</COREF> added. 


 <COREF ID="43" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF> will implement <COREF ID="44" REF="21">its system</COREF> later this year. 
 The details haven't yet been worked out, <COREF ID="46" REF="2">Chrysler</COREF> said. 


 According to a slide used in <COREF ID="47" REF="13">Mr. St. John</COREF>'s presentation, <COREF ID="48" REF="31">the policy</COREF> would cover all "professional, administrative, <COREF ID="-216" REF="12">management</COREF> and executive <COREF ID="-217" REF="16">employees</COREF>." 
 <COREF ID="49" REF="32">It</COREF> would also have <COREF ID="50" REF="3">a four-step grievance process</COREF>, just as <COREF ID="51">UAW</COREF>-represented workers have.
