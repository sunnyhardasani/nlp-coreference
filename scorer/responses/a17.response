HALF MOON BAY, Calif.  <COREF ID="6" REF="2">Joe Reid</COREF>, who died Thursday when the
airplane <COREF ID="53" REF="10">he</COREF> was flying with <COREF ID="-16" REF="37">7-year-old Jessica Dubroff</COREF> and her
father crashed <COREF ID="-26" REF="39">i</COREF>n Cheyenne, Wyo., took up flying the same way <COREF ID="10" REF="53">he</COREF>
did anything else: with passion and attention to detail.


``I respected <COREF ID="11" REF="12">his</COREF> leadership, <COREF ID="12" REF="11">his</COREF> thoroughness,'' said Gary
Petersen, <COREF ID="13">manager</COREF> of <COREF ID="-33" REF="19">Half Moon Bay Airport</COREF>. ``<COREF ID="15" REF="53">He</COREF> was always capable
and competent, <COREF ID="16">a real by-the-book guy</COREF>  @amp;MD;  very thorough, very
detailed.''


<COREF ID="17" REF="2">Reid</COREF>, 52, who for nearly 27 years was <COREF ID="18">a broker at the Dean
Witter Reynolds office in Palo Alto</COREF>, was <COREF ID="19" REF="49">president of the Half Moon
Bay Pilots Association</COREF>.


<COREF ID="-40" REF="34">George Auld</COREF>, <COREF ID="20" REF="-40">a longtime friend</COREF> who co-owned the aircraft that
crashed, said <COREF ID="22" REF="53">he</COREF> had first taken <COREF ID="23" REF="2">Reid</COREF> up in a small <COREF ID="-44" REF="29">plane</COREF> in 1970.
<COREF ID="24" REF="53">He</COREF> said <COREF ID="25" REF="2">Reid</COREF>, <COREF ID="26" REF="25">a Vietnam veteran</COREF>, got <COREF ID="27" REF="11">his</COREF> <COREF ID="-47" REF="47">pilot</COREF>'s license in the
late 1970s and was certified to be <COREF ID="28">an instructor</COREF> about four years
ago.


<COREF ID="-50" REF="58">They</COREF> bought <COREF ID="29" REF="-44">the plane</COREF>, <COREF ID="30" REF="29">a 1975 single-engine Cessna 177B
Cardinal</COREF>, about nine years ago.


``<COREF ID="31" REF="53">He</COREF> loved <COREF ID="32" REF="33">flying</COREF> and helping other people learn the excitement
of <COREF ID="33" REF="32">flying</COREF>,'' <COREF ID="34" REF="-40">Auld</COREF> said. ``<COREF ID="35" REF="4">Joe</COREF>'s not the type to do anything <COREF ID="-59" REF="19">half</COREF>
way.''


<COREF ID="36" REF="2">Reid</COREF> began giving lessons to <COREF ID="37" REF="-16">Jessica</COREF> about five months ago and
was supportive of <COREF ID="38" REF="40">her</COREF> effort to become the youngest person ever to
make a round-trip, cross-country flight in the United States.


``<COREF ID="39" REF="41">I</COREF>'m teaching <COREF ID="40" REF="38">her</COREF> just like <COREF ID="41" REF="39">I</COREF> would anybody else,'' <COREF ID="42" REF="53">he</COREF> said.
``Mentally, <COREF ID="43">she</COREF> grasps the concepts as well as an adult.''


Forrest Storz, who also gives <COREF ID="44" REF="32">flying</COREF> lessons at the airport,
called <COREF ID="46" REF="2">Reid</COREF> <COREF ID="47" REF="-47">``an exceptional, competent pilot.''</COREF>


<COREF ID="48" REF="2">Reid</COREF>, who grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and was graduated from
Saint Mary of the Plains College in Dodge City, Kan., was active in
the <COREF ID="49" REF="19">Half Moon Bay</COREF> community and serving a fourth term on the
Coastside County Water District board. <COREF ID="50" REF="53">He</COREF> also was <COREF ID="51" REF="19">a member of the
San Mateo County Airport Land Use Committee</COREF> and was <COREF ID="52" REF="19">chairman of the
annual Half Moon Bay Fly-In and Air Show</COREF>.


He and his wife, <COREF ID="-92">Ana</COREF>, were <COREF ID="57" REF="-92">active parishioners</COREF> at Our Lady of
the Pillar Catholic Church. <COREF ID="58" REF="-50">They</COREF> had two sons, Christopher, 27, of
Occidental, and Matthew, 23, of Half <COREF ID="-102" REF="19">Moon Bay</COREF>.
