WASHINGTON  @amp;MD;  The <COREF ID="3" REF="10">Navy</COREF> suspended <COREF ID="-17" REF="36">operations</COREF> for <COREF ID="4">its</COREF> entire <COREF ID="-18" REF="43">fleet</COREF>
of <COREF ID="-19" REF="2">F-14</COREF> airplanes <COREF ID="-21" REF="17">Thursday</COREF> after <COREF ID="6" REF="16">the third ``Tomcat'' crash in a
month</COREF>  @amp;MD;  <COREF ID="8" REF="6">the second in a week</COREF>.


The 72-hour ``safety <COREF ID="-25" REF="34">stand-down</COREF>'' came shortly after an <COREF ID="-27" REF="2">F-14</COREF>
<COREF ID="-28" REF="54">fighter</COREF> from the USS Nimitz crashed during flight <COREF ID="-32" REF="36">operations</COREF> in the
northern Persian Gulf at about 6:30 a.m. EST.


The <COREF ID="10" REF="3">Navy</COREF> announced that the two Naval aviators on board were
rescued by a SH-60 helicopter after <COREF ID="11" REF="66">they</COREF> ejected from <COREF ID="12" REF="23">the aircraft</COREF>.
The <COREF ID="13" REF="3">Navy</COREF> said that <COREF ID="14">both men</COREF> were in good condition. One aviator
suffered minor abrasions. The <COREF ID="15" REF="3">Navy</COREF> is investigating the cause.


<COREF ID="-50" REF="18">Another Tomcat</COREF> crashed off the coast of California during
exercises on the aircraft carrier Carl Vinson on Sunday. Both crew
members were killed. Late last month, an <COREF ID="-64" REF="2">F-14</COREF> crashed near
Nashville, killing both crew members and three civilians on the
ground.


Although <COREF ID="16" REF="6">the crash</COREF> <COREF ID="17" REF="39">Thursday</COREF> was <COREF ID="18" REF="6">the third Tomcat crash</COREF> this
year, Defense Department spokesman Kenneth Bacon said the <COREF ID="22" REF="3">Navy</COREF> had
uncovered no evidence of a flaw in <COREF ID="23" REF="12">the aircraft</COREF>.


A safety <COREF ID="-81" REF="34">stand-down</COREF> is <COREF ID="24">a procedure the military uses to conduct
an intensive review</COREF>. During <COREF ID="25">this three-day period</COREF>, the three
classes of <COREF ID="27" REF="35">F-14s</COREF> will stay out of the air so <COREF ID="28" REF="3">Navy</COREF> personnel can
review maintenance procedures and equipment, plus check each
<COREF ID="-91" REF="12">aircraft</COREF> for weaknesses or deficiencies.


The <COREF ID="-123" REF="27">F-14s</COREF> on the deck of the USS America will be allowed to fly
off because <COREF ID="29" REF="12">the aircraft carrier</COREF> is returning from a deployment.
Carrier decks are routinely cleared of aircraft the day before the
<COREF ID="30" REF="29">carrier</COREF> docks.


``We do not know what has caused these three <COREF ID="-137" REF="6">crash</COREF>es this
year,'' <COREF ID="33" REF="45">Bacon</COREF> said. ``The goal of <COREF ID="34" REF="-25">the stand-down</COREF> is to take a time
out to look at everything involved with <COREF ID="35" REF="27">the F-14s</COREF>.


Adm. Jeremy Boorda, <COREF ID="36" REF="-17">the chief of Naval Operations</COREF>, informed
Deputy Defense Secretary John White of <COREF ID="38" REF="6">the latest crash</COREF> <COREF ID="39" REF="17">Thursday</COREF>
morning and told <COREF ID="40">him</COREF> <COREF ID="41">he</COREF> was ordering <COREF ID="42">the standdown</COREF> for <COREF ID="43" REF="12">the entire
fleet of more than 300 aircraft</COREF>, <COREF ID="45" REF="33">Bacon</COREF> said.


``What the <COREF ID="46" REF="3">Navy</COREF> is trying to do is find out what caused <COREF ID="47" REF="67">these
accidents</COREF>,'' <COREF ID="48" REF="33">Bacon</COREF> said.


In the past five years, 32 F-14s have crashed. One of the
Navy's first female pilots, <COREF ID="50">Lt. Kara Hultgren</COREF>, died while trying to
land an F-14 on an aircraft carrier in 1994. The <COREF ID="51" REF="3">Navy</COREF> concluded
that engine failure caused that crash.


<COREF ID="52" REF="18">The Tomcat</COREF>, <COREF ID="53" REF="12">a $38 million, twin-engine aircraft</COREF> built by the
Grumman Aerospace Corp., is <COREF ID="54" REF="-28">the standard fighter plane</COREF> used by the
Navy for close-in air combat. <COREF ID="56" REF="12">The aircraft</COREF> has been in operation
since 1973. The oldest version of the aircraft, <COREF ID="58">the F-14A</COREF>, is
scheduled to be phased out by the year 2004.


The crash rate for <COREF ID="59" REF="2">the F-14</COREF> dropped dramatically after the
initial years of deployment and has generally gone down since <COREF ID="60">then</COREF>
except for occasional spurts of accidents, according to Naval
records.


<COREF ID="61" REF="33">Bacon</COREF> said the <COREF ID="62" REF="3">Navy</COREF> had no single explanation for the increases
in <COREF ID="63" REF="2">F-14</COREF> accidents.


``The <COREF ID="64" REF="3">Navy</COREF> informs <COREF ID="65">me</COREF> that <COREF ID="66" REF="11">they</COREF> have been unable to find a
common thread to <COREF ID="67" REF="47">these accidents</COREF>,'' <COREF ID="68" REF="33">Bacon</COREF> said. ``This is <COREF ID="69">a
mystery</COREF>.''
